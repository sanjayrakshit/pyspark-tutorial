# Pyspark tutorial

It is imperative that someone who is working with alot of data knows about Apache pyspark.

This is my attempt of learning how to use pyspark. Since this is my very first attempt, I have kept things simple and I've taken almost everything from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C8kWso4ne4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

This is supposed to be a living repository, I will put more notebooks and projects as I keep learning.

Have a look at this very first [notebook](notebooks/init.ipynb)
